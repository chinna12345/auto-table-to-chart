= Introduction =

Auto-table-to-chart (AttC) is a bit a javascript that converts a standard HTML table to a Open Flash Chart on the page.
It is built on the following:
 * Open Flash Chart 2 - http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart-2
 * Jquery  - http://jquery.com

= Details =

To use you need to include the javascript in the head of your page:
{{{
<script src="js/jquery/jquery.js" type="text/JavaScript"></script>
<script src="js/openflashchart/js/swfobject.js" type="text/JavaScript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/openflashchart/js/json2.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/attc.js"></script>
}}}

and then add the basic css to the head:
{{{
<style type="text/css">
@import url(css/flash_chart_style.css);
</style>
}}}

Your table should be of the format:
{{{
<table>
<caption>Some totals</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Heading</th>
</tr>
</thead>		
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>content</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
<table>
}}}
as the script looks for <thead> and <tbody> sections to get its information, <tfoot> can be used but is ignored at present

to get a basic bar graph you add some css classes to the {{{<table>}}} tag and the {{{<th>}}} tags - like this:
{{{
<table class="graph_table chart_type_pie" id="a_table">
<caption>Some totals</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="graph_id" title="heading">Heading</th>
<th class="graph_value" title="total">Total</th>
</tr>
</thead>		
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>south</th>
<th>10</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>north</th>
<th>20</th>
</tr>
</tbody>
<table>
}}}
possible {{{<table>}}} css classes to setup the graph are:
 * graph_table - needed to get the table to be converted to a graph on page load
 * chart_type_pie - Show the graph as a pie chart
 * chart_type_bar - Show the graph as a bar chart
 * chart_type_bar_3d - Show the graph as a bar_3d chart
 * chart_type_line - Show the graph as a line chart
 * table_hidden - default the table to hidden
 * chart_hidden - default the chart to hidden

possible {{{<th>}}} css classes to setup the plots are:

 * graph_id the x axis labels (only one {{{<th>}}} can should this class)
 * graph_value the y axis values (multiple {{{<th>}}} can have this class, unless it is a pie chart, then only one is used)
 * graph_value_stack combined with 'chart_type_bar' shows the values stacked on top of one another - use instead of 'graph_value'
 * skip{{{#_#_#_#}}} - where # are the row numbers to skip
 * steps{{{_#}}} - where # is the value of steps to use on the y axis, overrides the automatic calculation of steps (only one {{{<th>}}} should have this class) 
 

You can style the chart using the style sheet: 'flash_chart_style.css' in the css folder of the download, please see the comments in there for more info. The chart id for css and javascript is 'flash_chart_'+the_table_id.

take a look at the download for working examples of the various css class options.
